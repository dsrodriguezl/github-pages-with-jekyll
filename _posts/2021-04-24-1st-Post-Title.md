This is my first post. so far, is not so different to just add a text file,although the content of a blog could be the most difficult and important part.
I guess some blog wirtting tips are not included in this learning lab ðŸ˜…. Anyway, I will learn on the way. If I can write papers, why wouldn't I be able to write a blog?

I know this is a kind of weird post, but I just felt like putting some sort of real speech this time, to make it less boring, so why not putting exactly what I am thinking?
Cannot harm, can it?
